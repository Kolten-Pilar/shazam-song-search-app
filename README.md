# Shazam API based Song Searching App
# PerScholas / Project 2
- This is my second project for PerScholas. It is based on all of the React reposistories we have made in class. 
- (insert hosted url when available)
- Link to API used: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam
--------------------------------------------------

# App Description
- This app is a song searching app that uses the Shazam API to search for songs based on the user's input.
- The user can search for a song by typing in the song name and artist name in the search bar (only the song name is required, but adding the artist will narrow results).
- The results will be the top track from the first hits array in the API response.

# Approach Taken
- I started by creating a new React app using the Vite template and deleted unnecessary files.
- I based my styling off of the Apple CarPlay music app.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
